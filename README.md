# Vivian-Project-6-Work

## Explanation on the issue!

So starting at the beginning of the year as you are aware, I have two types of pythons on my computer!! One was downloaded by Conda and another was downloaded by (I THINK) homebrew or just the python mac os option! I had missed the first two weeks but when I came back I stayed after a lab so that you could help me fix my python as it wasn't linked to my github!! During the last few weeks and especially after the hackathon after I had to make a few modifications to my python I ran into the issue again where I was struggling to commit! 

I had completed most of the work on project 6 the 14th of April but I had messages that my imports weren't working or that I didn't have things installed? I figured it didn't go through and so I would use a token but when I had looked at your email later it said I got a 1.00 on my project 6! I wasn't sure how so but I wasn't going to argue or mess with it if my grade was good so I didn't touch the repo after my token was submitted. I had the issue for another project but for 7 it worked with the correct python so I didn't think much of it. 

Overall I am aware that I should've looked into it more but I thought I had worked it out in the end and with the final coming along and planning with my family for moving I just decided I wouldn't dwell on it if it seemed fine! 

When I finally read the email stating that there was a mistake and you recieved no work, I obviously wanted to make sure that you saw it! For one it would help my grade but as I planned on furthering my skills in the summer so feedback would be great. 

I understand if you cannot give me a grade due to the unconventional way you are now recieving this but I figure it didn't hurt to at least show you my work, if not for a grade for well respected feedback.

## The Repo

I've labeled each file with the same names you had the files labeled in project 6 and copied in the work I had done initially so hopefully it will be easy to view! 

## Final thoughts

Again I apologize for the inconvience but if you could still provided me with feedback none the less it would be much appreciated.

Thank you Professor for a great year. See you in the Spring!!
