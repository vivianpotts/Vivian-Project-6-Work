## Example of inconsistencies?

- I don't have any on the commit since it won't even let me commit now but here are just a few examples of some stuff that was just inconsistent or I wasn't sure on?

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/vivianpotts/Desktop/Comp Sci 202/computer-science-202-algorithm-engineering-project-6-vivianpotts/lcsfinder/lcsfinder/benchmark.py", line 8, in <module>
    from .generate import generate_data
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

```python
Cannot find implementation or library stub for module named "generate"
```
